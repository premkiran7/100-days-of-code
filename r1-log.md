# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [K Prem Kiran]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 7, Monday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D0

Spent ~2 hours and finished the Basic HTML and CSS challenges as part of the Responsive Web Design Certification

### R1D1

Have to improve tomorrow after a poor start

### R1D2

These challenges got very boring today. I wonder how much I will remember of what I do or how useful they will be for me as most of them just involve changing few lines of code in the editor.

### R1D3

Understood the power of flexbox and grid in particular. Wonder what the future has in store one day when people find faults with CSS grid.

### R1D4

I should have taken less time to complete the tribute page but I messed up. Have to revisit grid and check what I have to change to get the required result.

### R1D5

Completed Tribute Page work. 1 down 4 to go. Took a lot of time to complete the work, but I think I will improve as time passes and I work on more projects. Still need to understand a lot of things clearly.

### R1D6

Completed Survey Form work. 2 down 3 to go. Target was to complete all the remaining 3 projects also today but I think I am setting lofty/impractical goals.

### R1D7

Wanted to finish the remaining projects today itself, but couldn't. I have to work faster. Most of my time gets wasted as I get confused with basic things like position, display etc.

### R1D8

2 more to go. Just can't wait to get it done and take some rest. I have noticed that either my basics ain't clear in CSS or maybe I need more time as I found myself struggling with the logo on the navbar today.

### R1D9

1 more to go. Will be working on the big fish (portfolio project) that I had wanted to build. Today was a not so productive day. Had lots of mood swings (feelings of hope, positivity, fear, despair, helplessness). I just want to keep going and not worry about my end goals of this journey.
