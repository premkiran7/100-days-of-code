# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [K Prem Kiran]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 7, Monday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D0

Spent ~2 hours and finished the Basic HTML and CSS challenges as part of the Responsive Web Design Certification

### R1D1

Have to improve tomorrow after a poor start

### R1D2

These challenges got very boring today. I wonder how much I will remember of what I do or how useful they will be for me as most of them just involve changing few lines of code in the editor.

### R1D3

Understood the power of flexbox and grid in particular. Wonder what the future has in store one day when people find faults with CSS grid.

### R1D4

I should have taken less time to complete the tribute page but I messed up. Have to revisit grid and check what I have to change to get the required result.

### R1D5

Completed Tribute Page work. 1 down 4 to go. Took a lot of time to complete the work, but I think I will improve as time passes and I work on more projects. Still need to understand a lot of things clearly.

### R1D6

Completed Survey Form work. 2 down 3 to go. Target was to complete all the remaining 3 projects also today but I think I am setting lofty/impractical goals.

### R1D7

Wanted to finish the remaining projects today itself, but couldn't. I have to work faster. Most of my time gets wasted as I get confused with basic things like position, display etc.

### R1D8

2 more to go. Just can't wait to get it done and take some rest. I have noticed that either my basics ain't clear in CSS or maybe I need more time as I found myself struggling with the logo on the navbar today.

### R1D9

1 more to go. Will be working on the big fish (portfolio project) that I had wanted to build. Today was a not so productive day. Had lots of mood swings (feelings of hope, positivity, fear, despair, helplessness). I just want to keep going and not worry about my end goals of this journey.

### R1D10

Nothing much today. Spent time learning about open source and hacktoberfest.

### R1D11

Finally I completed the responsive web design certification, Phew! felt like eternity to me. Still lots of feedback to work on, but I am happy that I could atleast complete the work up to some extent. I now feel confident that I can atleast get going with HTML and CSS.

Learnings

- Things only seem complex until we start doing it
- Practice makes a web developer perfect
- Accessibility is important, web is for everyone, develop empathy towards all users

### R1D12

Wanted to start frontend masters tutorials (professional path), finish all challenges today and start with projects from tomorrow but couldn't reach my target. Have to pickup. Time is the most valuable asset.

### R1D13

Plan was to finish the challenges today, but some still remain.

### R1D14

With 3 days remaining in the week, need to buck up and finish up remaining work.

### R1D15

Completed 1 of the 2 remaining projects of JS DS & Algo Challenges on freeCodeCamp

### R1D16

Completed JS DS & Algo Certification.

### R1D17

Got distracted with hacktoberfest PR's over the last few days

### R1D18

Completed the Frontend Libraries Challenges. Back after a long gap
