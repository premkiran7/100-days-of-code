### Day 2: September 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Completed Visual Design, Accesibility and Responsive Design challenges. Understood importance of new HTML5 tags (nav, section, header, footer, article etc) in the context of accessibility, css animations etc. Wanted to finish flexbox and grid and start with projects tomorrow but got bored.

**Thoughts:**

These challenges got very boring today. I wonder how much I will remember of what I do or how useful they will be for me as most of them just involve changing few lines of code in the editor.

### Day 3: September 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Finished flexbox and grid challenges. Already had a headstart with these two before. Started with the responsive design projects

**Thoughts:**

Understood the power of flexbox and grid in particular. Wonder what the future has in store one day when people find faults with CSS grid.

### Day 4: September 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Started work on a tribute page using CSS Grid. Couldn't complete what I wanted to do. Wanted to add a scroll for the timeline but didn't figure out how.

**Thoughts:**

I should have taken less time to complete the tribute page but I messed up. Have to revisit grid, check what I have to change to get the required result.

### Day 5: September 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Finished work on the tribute page (First responsive design project on FreeCodeCamp). Learnt about viewport units, object-fit, object-position properties, replaced elements. pseudo elements etc. Built a [vertical response timeline](https://github.com/Mathunes/timeline) by modifying it as per my use case.

**Thoughts:**

Completed Tribute Page work. 1 down 4 to go. Took a lot of time to complete the work, but I think I will improve as time passes and I work on more projects. Still need to understand a lot of things clearly.

### Day 6: September 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Finished work on the survey form (Second responsive design project on FreeCodeCamp). Learnt about various form fields, datafield vs select, setting a perfect full page background image using background-size property etc

**Thoughts:**

Completed Survey Form work. 2 down 3 to go. Target was to complete all the remaining 3 projects also today but I think I am setting lofty/impractical goals.

### Day 7: September 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Worked on the product landing page (Third responsive design project on FreeCodeCamp). Took reference from traversy media. Learnt a lot about general coding patterns like usage of colours, proper commenting, usage of rems etc watching the [video](https://youtu.be/61R5kn_kYwY). Yet to finish work with media queries.

**Thoughts:**

Wanted to finish the remaining projects today itself, but couldn't. I have to work faster. Most of my time gets wasted as I get confused with basic things like position, display etc.

### Day 8: September 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Finished work on the product landing page and started work on the technical documentation page. Built accordions and navbars for the page.

**Thoughts:**

2 more to go. Just can't wait to get it done and take some rest. I have noticed that either my basics ain't clear in CSS or maybe I need more time as I found myself struggling with the logo on the navbar today.

### Day 9: September 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Finished work on the technical doc page. Wanted to create a floating button to access top nav bar on small devices similar to react docs but didn't do that. Was unable to create a fixed side nav bar with scrolling content. Referred some tutorials and tried but maybe my understanding was not perfect, so couldnâ€™t finish it and got frustrated :angry: :rage:

**Thoughts:**

1 more to go. Will be working on the big fish (portfolio project) that I had wanted to build. Today was a not so productive day. Had lots of mood swings (feelings of hope, positivity, fear, despair, helplessness). I just want to keep going and not worry about my end goals of this journey.

### Day 11: September 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Finished work on the personal portfolio webpage. Layout still breaks when screen width is below 650px for some elements. Have to figure out whether to use ems/rems for media queries.

**Thoughts:**

Finally I completed the responsive web design certification, Phew! felt like eternity to me. Still lots of feedback to work on, but I am happy that I could atleast complete the work up to some extent. I now feel confident that I can atleast get going with HTML and CSS.

Learnings

- Things only seem complex until we start doing it
- Practice makes a web developer perfect
- Accessibility is important, web is for everyone, develop empathy towards all users

### Day 12: September 22, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Started with the JS Algo & DS challenges. Got really bored doing these challenges in basic JS section as only some challenges were new to me.

**Thoughts:**

Wanted to start frontend masters tutorials (professional path), finish all challenges today and start with projects from tomorrow but couldn't reach my target. Have to pickup. Time is the most valuable asset.

### Day 13: September 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Finished some portion of the JS DS & Algo challenges. I did learn new things about JS, but felt that I was taking a lot of time. Working on these challenges kind of makes me lazy and get bored quickly, thus end I end up wasting my time. Need to balance.

**Thoughts:**

Plan was to finish the challenges today, but some still remain.

### Day 14: September 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

Finished 3 among the 5 projects of JS DS & Algo Challenges. Was expecting a lot from the projects, but felt disappointed. Anyways learnt a lot of things today like mixins, currying, prototypes etc. Need to find ways to use them.

**Thoughts:**

With 3 days remaining in the week, need to buck up and finish up remaining work.
